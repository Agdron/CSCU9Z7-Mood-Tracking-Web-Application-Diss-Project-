README File for Mood Tracker Dissertation Project by Duncan Mitchell 3024246

Various Online Code Libraries and Frameworks were used, all are linked within the HTML files

Most extensively used is the Bootstrap Framework (taught within the CSCU9X5 module)

The Bootstrap Framework:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css

And corresponding code Library:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js

The following links to code libraries were also used within the project, though given the extent of the project it is
not clear how extensive the use of them was:

https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js // It is a genuine surprise to me that I did not use this more than I did
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js // I believe this was used in part of the project which was later removed, so it may not be relevant
https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js // This is just the bootstrap library again but a different version. It is not consistent and may be relevant to updated functions

Chart.js is another library used for the chart found within admin-client.html

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js

Furthermore, some publicly available code on w3Schools with reference to HTML, CSS and Javascript has been borrowed and changed to fit the purpose of this project
Individual cases are not fully recorded, but it is known that the majority is in reference to the use tutorials of the bootstrap style and code frameworks

AS FAR AS I AM AWARE, THERE IS NO USE OF BOOTSTRAP 5 IN THIS PROJECT
